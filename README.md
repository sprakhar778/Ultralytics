## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of vision-based projects leveraging the power of Ultralytics' tools and models. It is designed to simplify the development of computer vision applications.

## Features

- Pre-trained models for object detection and segmentation.
- Easy-to-use APIs for training and inference.
- Support for custom datasets.
- High performance and scalability.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ultralytics-vision-projects.git
    cd ultralytics-vision-projects
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Train a model:
    ```bash
    python train.py --data <dataset.yaml> --cfg <model.yaml>
    ```

2. Run inference:
    ```bash
    python detect.py --weights <model.pt> --source <input>
    ```

3. Evaluate performance:
    ```bash
    python val.py --weights <model.pt> --data <dataset.yaml>
    ```
